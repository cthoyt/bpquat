BioPAX Quality Assessment

> **Note**
> This project is similar to
> the [Ontology Quality Assessment (oquat)](https://github.com/cthoyt/oquat)
> but specific for BioPAX models, such as those in Pathway Commons, Reactome,
> etc. mediated by [`pybiopax`](https://github.com/indralab/pybiopax).
> This can be used by those data sources to make their data more easy to
> integrate by showing them how to properly standardize their prefixes using
> the [Bioregistry](https://bioregistry.io).
